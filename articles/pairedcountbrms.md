# Getting started with pairedcountbrms

```

This vignette walks the package’s R API end to end on one family,
[`binegbin()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/binegbin.md):
simulate a matched pair of counts from known parameters, fit them, check
that the posterior finds the truth, and then predict and score. The
other joint family
([`bipois()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/bipois.md))
works identically with two fewer dpars; the difference families
([`skellam1()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/skellam1.md),
[`dnorm2()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/dnorm2.md),
and so on) are shown in the README.

Everything here is a brms custom family ([Bürkner
2017](#ref-burkner2017)), so the fitting, prediction and
model-comparison interfaces are brms’s own. The non-linear formula
syntax used further down is documented in Bürkner
([2018](#ref-burkner2018)).

## The generative model

[`binegbin()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/binegbin.md)
builds a bivariate count pair by **trivariate reduction** ([Karlis and
Ntzoufras 2003](#ref-karlis2003)). Three independent Negative-Binomial
counts are drawn, and the two observed counts share one of them:

``` math
\begin{aligned}
N_{\text{shared}} &\sim \mathrm{NB2}(\mu,\ \phi_s) \\
N_{10} &\sim \mathrm{NB2}(\lambda_{\text{em}},\ \phi_x) \qquad
N_{01} \sim \mathrm{NB2}(\lambda_{\text{lb}},\ \phi_x) \\[4pt]
y_{\text{em}} &= N_{\text{shared}} + N_{10} \qquad
y_{\text{lb}} = N_{\text{shared}} + N_{01}
\end{aligned}
```

The shared component is what both sources saw; the two excesses are what
each saw alone. $`N_{\text{shared}}`$ is never observed — it is
marginalised out analytically in the likelihood — but it is what induces
the correlation between the pair.

`NB2(m, phi)` is Stan’s `neg_binomial_2` and R’s
`dnbinom(size = phi, mu = m)`: mean `m`, variance `m + m^2/phi`. Larger
`phi` means *less* overdispersion.

Five dpars, all with a log link:

| dpar       | role                                           |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `mu`       | rate of the shared component                   |
| `lambdaem` | rate of the first source’s excess              |
| `lambdalb` | rate of the second source’s excess             |
| `shapes`   | dispersion $`\phi_s`$ of the shared component  |
| `shapex`   | dispersion $`\phi_x`$, shared by both excesses |

`mu` is brms’s mandatory first-dpar name. Here it is bound to the shared
component’s *rate* — it is not the mean of either response, and not the
mean of their difference. `E[y_em] = mu + lambdaem`.

All five use a log link, the conventional log-linear rate
parameterisation for this construction ([Karlis and Ntzoufras
2003](#ref-karlis2003)).

## Simulate from known parameters

``` r

set.seed(20260724)

n <- 400
truth <- list(
  mu       = 8,
  lambdaem = 3,
  lambdalb = 2,
  shapes   = 4,
  shapex   = 6
)

n_shared <- rnbinom(n, size = truth$shapes, mu = truth$mu)
n10      <- rnbinom(n, size = truth$shapex, mu = truth$lambdaem)
n01      <- rnbinom(n, size = truth$shapex, mu = truth$lambdalb)

dat <- data.frame(
  y_em = n_shared + n10,
  y_lb = n_shared + n01
)

str(dat)
#> 'data.frame':    400 obs. of  2 variables:
#>  $ y_em: num  11 8 7 15 5 13 9 15 13 8 ...
#>  $ y_lb: num  11 7 6 16 6 11 9 15 9 7 ...
cor(dat$y_em, dat$y_lb)
#> [1] 0.8911927
```

The correlation is positive and substantial because both counts carry
the same `n_shared`. That shared term is exactly what a model of the
difference alone throws away.

## Fit

Two things are specific to this package and easy to miss.

**The second count travels via `vint()`.**
[`brms::custom_family()`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/custom_family.html)
declares a single response column, so only `y_em` can be the response.
`y_lb` is passed alongside as supplementary integer data, and the
family’s Stan signature reads it from there.

**`stanvars` is not optional.**
[`binegbin_stanvars()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/binegbin.md)
injects the `binegbin_lpmf` Stan function into the model’s `functions`
block. Without it the generated model will not compile.

``` r

fit <- brm(
  bf(
    y_em | vint(y_lb) ~ 1,
    lambdaem          ~ 1,
    lambdalb          ~ 1,
    shapes            ~ 1,
    shapex            ~ 1
  ),
  family   = binegbin(),
  stanvars = binegbin_stanvars(),
  data     = dat,
  prior    = c(
    prior(normal(0, 3), class = "Intercept"),
    prior(normal(0, 3), class = "Intercept", dpar = "lambdaem"),
    prior(normal(0, 3), class = "Intercept", dpar = "lambdalb"),
    prior(normal(1, 2), class = "Intercept", dpar = "shapes"),
    prior(normal(1, 2), class = "Intercept", dpar = "shapex")
  ),
  chains  = 2,
  iter    = 1500,
  refresh = 0,
  backend = backend,
  seed    = 1
)
```

The priors are deliberately weak and not centred on the truth —
`normal(0, 3)` on a log rate spans roughly `[0.003, 400]`. With 400
observations the data does the work.

## Did it recover the truth?

All five dpars are log-linked, so each posterior intercept exponentiates
back onto the natural scale.

``` r

draws <- as_draws_df(fit)

pars <- c(
  mu       = "b_Intercept",
  lambdaem = "b_lambdaem_Intercept",
  lambdalb = "b_lambdalb_Intercept",
  shapes   = "b_shapes_Intercept",
  shapex   = "b_shapex_Intercept"
)

recovery <- do.call(rbind, lapply(names(pars), function(p) {
  x <- exp(draws[[pars[[p]]]])
  data.frame(
    dpar  = p,
    truth = truth[[p]],
    est   = median(x),
    lower = unname(quantile(x, 0.025)),
    upper = unname(quantile(x, 0.975))
  )
}))
recovery$covered <- with(recovery, truth >= lower & truth <= upper)

knitr::kable(recovery, digits = 2)
```

| dpar     | truth |  est | lower | upper | covered |
|:---------|------:|-----:|------:|------:|:--------|
| mu       |     8 | 8.48 |  7.73 |  9.21 | TRUE    |
| lambdaem |     3 | 2.78 |  2.29 |  3.41 | TRUE    |
| lambdalb |     2 | 1.84 |  1.38 |  2.45 | TRUE    |
| shapes   |     4 | 3.89 |  2.94 |  5.07 | TRUE    |
| shapex   |     6 | 5.82 |  2.56 | 29.93 | TRUE    |

The three rates should land tightly on their true values. The two
dispersions are estimated from an aggregate mean–variance mismatch
rather than from any directly observed quantity, so their intervals are
wider — `shapex` especially, since it is identified only through the
part of the pair’s spread that the shared component cannot explain. Wide
but covering is the expected result here, not a warning sign.

## Predict and score

[`posterior_predict()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/reference/posterior_predict.html)
draws new `y_em` **conditional on each row’s observed `y_lb`**. It
samples the discrete conditional distribution of $`N_{\text{shared}}`$
given `y_lb`, then adds a fresh excess draw — the exact conditional, not
an approximation.

``` r

yrep <- posterior_predict(fit, ndraws = 200)
dim(yrep)
#> [1] 200 400

data.frame(
  quantity = c("mean", "sd", "max"),
  observed = c(mean(dat$y_em), sd(dat$y_em), max(dat$y_em)),
  predicted = c(mean(yrep), mean(apply(yrep, 1, sd)), mean(apply(yrep, 1, max)))
) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| quantity | observed | predicted |
|:---------|---------:|----------:|
| mean     |    11.25 |     11.27 |
| sd       |     5.59 |      5.53 |
| max      |    37.00 |     34.13 |

[`log_lik()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/reference/log_lik.html)
gives the pointwise log-likelihood of the *joint* pair, evaluated by an
independent R implementation of the same marginalisation sum that the
Stan function computes. It feeds
[`loo()`](https://mc-stan.org/loo/reference/loo.html) and
[`waic()`](https://mc-stan.org/loo/reference/waic.html) in the usual way
([Vehtari et al. 2017](#ref-vehtari2017)). The Pareto $`k`$ diagnostic
reported alongside the estimate flags observations whose importance
weights are unreliable ([Vehtari et al. 2024](#ref-vehtari2024)).

``` r

ll <- log_lik(fit)
dim(ll)
#> [1] 1500  400

loo(fit)
#> 
#> Computed from 1500 by 400 log-likelihood matrix.
#> 
#>          Estimate   SE
#> elpd_loo  -2146.4 22.7
#> p_loo         4.9  0.5
#> looic      4292.8 45.4
#> ------
#> MCSE of elpd_loo is 0.1.
#> MCSE and ESS estimates assume MCMC draws (r_eff in [0.4, 1.4]).
#> 
#> All Pareto k estimates are good (k < 0.69).
#> See help('pareto-k-diagnostic') for details.
```

## One limitation to know about

[`posterior_epred()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/reference/posterior_epred.html)
— and its aliases
[`fitted()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/fitted.values.html) and
[`conditional_effects()`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/conditional_effects.brmsfit.html)
— **errors on any truncated custom-family fit** in brms 2.23.0. The
dispatcher checks for truncation before it checks the family type, and
the truncated branch has no fallback to `posterior_epred_custom()`. This
is a brms limitation, not a bug in this package.

On a truncated fit, call the family’s method directly:

``` r

posterior_epred_binegbin(prepare_predictions(fit))
```

[`posterior_predict()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/reference/posterior_predict.html)
and [`log_lik()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/reference/log_lik.html)
are unaffected and work correctly with truncation.

## Where to go next

- [`bipois()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/bipois.md)
  — the non-overdispersed Poisson sibling. Same construction, three
  dpars instead of five. Use it when the margins are not overdispersed;
  compare the two with
  [`loo()`](https://mc-stan.org/loo/reference/loo.html).
- [`binegbin_joint()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/binegbin_joint.md)
  — censoring-aware, for data where one of the two counts is missing on
  some rows. It admits those rows via the integrated-out marginal
  instead of dropping them.
- [`skellam1()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/skellam1.md)
  /
  [`skellam2()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/skellam2.md),
  [`dnorm1()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/dnorm1.md)
  /
  [`dnorm2()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/dnorm2.md),
  [`dlaplace1()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/dlaplace1.md)
  /
  [`dlaplace2()`](https://anhsmith.github.io/pairedcountbrms/reference/dlaplace2.md)
  — the difference families, which model `d = y_em - y_lb` directly. The
  `1` variants fix the location at zero (does the pair agree on
  average?); the `2` variants estimate it (by how much do they
  disagree?). All support truncation through
  [`resp_trunc()`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/addition-terms.html).
  The difference of two independent Poisson counts is
  Skellam-distributed ([Skellam 1946](#ref-skellam1946)); for the
  Bayesian treatment of count differences generally, see Karlis and
  Ntzoufras ([2006](#ref-karlis2006)).
